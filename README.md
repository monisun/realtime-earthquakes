Real-time earthquakes is a service that allows users to map earthquakes based on input params, such as GPS location, UTC time of occurrence (sec), and/or magnitude. A cron job runs once per minute to download updated earthquake data from USGS.

The debug option allows users to force a data fetch from USGS based on a selected time period. The map displays markers to indicate the earthquakes that occurred in North America for that particular time period.

A demo of the app can be found at http://earthquakes.monicasun.net/
